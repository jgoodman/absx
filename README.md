# ABSX

The acronym stands for "Actor Based Syntax".

Run bin/absx to start an object oriented console interface. From there, you would declare commands in "noun/verb" fashion (aka actor/action). For example...

  absx > console helps

The above would display help information in regards to the console actor.
